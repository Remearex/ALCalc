# ALCalc
all calculations regarding AL

this is still in development, uploading this here just so people can have a reference of the source code I use for all my calculations

to view source code go to ALCalculatorSolution, then ALCalculator. You can see all the source files and header files and such. For those looking for EDPS calc formulas most of it is in Main.cpp and CalcFunctions.cpp but the parameter lists are in ParameterClasses.h if you are confused about what all the "GunPL" classes are.
